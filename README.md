[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/prideout/par.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/prideout/par)

## par

Single-file C libraries under the MIT license, mostly graphics related.
Documentation can be found at the top of each header file, but some libraries have an accompanying blog post.
The most useful ones are listed in the following table.

library    | description  | link
------------------- | ---- | ---
**par_camera_control.h** | orbit controller, or pan-and-zoom like Google Maps | [demo project](https://github.com/prideout/camera_demo)
**par_octasphere.h** | malloc-free mesh gen for spheres and rounded cuboids | [blog post](https://prideout.net/blog/octasphere)
**par_streamlines.h** | triangulate wide lines and curves | [blog post](https://prideout.net/blog/par_streamlines/)
**par_string_blocks.h** | string manager for snippets of Lua or GLSL |
**par_shapes.h** | generate parametric surfaces and other simple shapes | [blog post](https://prideout.net/shapes)

There are more libraries too but they're probably less useful; scroll to the bottom of this README.

## tests

To run tests, you need CMake and libcurl.  On OS X, these can be installed with homebrew:

```bash
$ brew install cmake pkg-config curl
```

Here's how you can tell CMake to use the CMakeLists in the `test` folder, placing all the messy stuff in a new folder called `build`.

```bash
$ cmake test -Bbuild   # Create makefiles
$ cmake --build build  # Invoke the build
```

The tests are executed by simply running the programs:
```bash
$ build/test_msquares
$ build/test_bluenoise
$ build/test_bubbles
$ build/test_shapes
```

## code formatting

This library's code style is strictly enforced to be vertically dense (no consecutive newlines) and 100 columns or less.

The `tools/format.py` script invokes a two-step code formatting process:

1. Runs `uncrustify` with our custom configuration.  This auto-formats all code in the root folder, up to a point.
1. Checks for violations that are not otherwise enforced with uncrustify.

The aforementioned Python script is also invoked from Travis, but using the `--check` option, which checks for conformance without editing the code.

Beyond what our uncrustify configuration enforces, the Python script does the following:

- Checks that no lines are more than 100 chars.
- Checks for extra newlines before an end brace.
